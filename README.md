# Maplestory flag race simulator
A simulator for maplestory's flag race.

Built using Phaser 3 and Matter physics.

## Usage
1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`


## Goal
The end goal of this simulator is replicate the flag race minigame in Maplestory as closely as possible.
The main goal is mostly self-learning and discovering how good and bad Maplestory's physics system is.

## Contributions
Any contributions are welcomed!

A lot of things still need work:
1. Fixing physics for collision and player movement to be as close to the real game as possible.
2. Improving tilemap layout
3. Improving asset quality.
